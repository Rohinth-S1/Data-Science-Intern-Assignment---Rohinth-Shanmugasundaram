Question 20:
In a pathology lab test, there are n number of samples for testing the health condition of a patient,
each slide has 5 components, Sugar level, Blood pressure, Heartbeat rate, weight and fat percentage,
based on input as provided by the patient's blood report.

1. Create a sample input for a healthy patient as follows:

"Sugar level":15, "Blood pressure":32, "Heartbeat rate":71, "weight":65, "fat percentage":10.

2. Get values from the user and compare inputs with healthy patient data. If the patient data is not matching with the healthy
patientâ€™s data, provide a warning.

3. Provide difference in readings to the patient.
